Software Shokunin Community
==================

As aspiring Software Shokunin we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

* Not only working software : **but also well-crafted software**
* Not only responding to change : **but also steadily adding value**
* Not only individuals and interactions : **but also a community of professionals**
* Not only customer collaboration : **but also productive partnerships**

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

Refactoring Legacy Code
------------------

The refactoring legacy code session is all about... refactoring legacy code! We're going to take an unruly code base and work in pairs to refactor it.

### Setup

You will need the following installed on your machine:

* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/)
* [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml)
* [eclipse / intellij](https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=java+ide)

### Installation

You will need to pull down some docker images before the session, see the READMEs in the ruby and js folders...
