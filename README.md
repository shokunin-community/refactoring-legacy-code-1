* Not only responding to change : _*but also steadily adding value*_

* Not only individuals and interactions : _*but also a community of professionals*_

* Not only customer collaboration : _*but also productive partnerships*_

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
